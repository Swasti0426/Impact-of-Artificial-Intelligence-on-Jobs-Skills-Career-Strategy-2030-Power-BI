# 🤖 Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Jobs, Skills & Career Strategy (2030)

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **automation** are expected to transform jobs, skills, salaries, and career sustainability by the year **2030**. Using **Power BI** as a Business Intelligence tool, the project converts complex workforce data into interactive dashboards that support informed, data-driven career and workforce planning decisions.
The analysis focuses on automation risk, AI exposure, skill relevance, salary distribution, and long-term career resilience across various job roles, education levels, and experience bands.

🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze the impact of AI and automation on future job roles
* Identify skills critical for long-term career sustainability
* Assess automation probability and AI exposure across professions
* Study salary trends by job role, education, and experience
* Support strategic career planning and workforce transformation

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Power BI – Data modeling and interactive dashboards
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and KPIs
Excel / CSV Dataset – AI Impact on Jobs 2030 dataset

 📊 Key Metrics & KPIs

* Average, Minimum, and Maximum Salary
* Automation Probability (2030)
* AI Exposure Index
* Skill Count & Skill Strength
* Career Growth Factor
* Experience vs Salary Progression
* Risk Categorization (Low / Medium / High)

 🔄 Methodology

1. Imported and modeled the dataset in Power BI
2. Validated data for consistency and accuracy
3. Performed feature engineering by renaming generic skill columns into real-world competencies
4. Created custom DAX measures for salary, risk, and skill indicators
5. Built interactive dashboards using slicers, drill-downs, and hierarchies
6. Interpreted insights to support strategic career and workforce decisions

📈 Key Insights

* Knowledge-intensive and skill-driven roles show lower automation risk
* Salary alone does not guarantee job security
* Skill diversity significantly improves career resilience
* Analytical, technical, and data-centric skills reduce AI exposure
* Career growth stabilizes after mid-level experience, making upskilling essential
* Routine and repetitive roles face the highest automation risk

🧠 Strategic Recommendations

* Individuals should adopt continuous learning and skill diversification
* Career planning must include automation risk, not just salary growth
* Organizations should invest in reskilling and AI-resilient workforce strategies
* Educational institutions should align curricula with future-ready skills
